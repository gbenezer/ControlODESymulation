# Welcome to ControlDESymulation

A comprehensive control systems simulation framework with symbolic dynamical systems and multi-backend numerical execution.

## Key Benefits

1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: Define systems symbolically, execute on any backend (NumPy/PyTorch/JAX)
2. **No Backend Lock-in**: Switch between CPU, GPU, or TPU without changing your code
3. **Gradient-Aware**: Automatic differentiation support for learned controllers and neural ODEs
4. **Type-Safe**: Comprehensive type hints for better IDE support and fewer bugs
5. **Research to Production**: Prototype in NumPy, scale with JAX, integrate with PyTorch models

## Features

- **Symbolic Specification**: Define systems using SymPy with automatic code generation
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Seamlessly switch between NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, and Julia
- **Dual Time Domains**: Full support for both continuous-time (ODEs/SDEs) and discrete-time systems
- **Stochastic Systems**: First-class support for stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
- **40+ Integration Methods**: Adaptive and fixed-step solvers from scipy, torchdiffeq, diffrax, and DiffEqPy
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypedDict definitions with IDE autocomplete support
- **GPU Acceleration**: Native PyTorch and JAX support for GPU-based simulations
- **Zero Code Duplication**: Clean 4-layer architecture with composition over inheritance
- **Production Ready**: Extensive test coverage, comprehensive documentation, CI/CD workflows

## Design Principles

1. **Composition Over Inheritance** - Delegate to specialized utilities
2. **Backend Agnosticism** - Write once, run on NumPy/PyTorch/JAX/Julia
3. **Type-Driven Design** - Comprehensive TypedDict definitions
4. **Zero Code Duplication** - Shared functionality in base classes
5. **Mathematical Rigor** - Proper handling of ODEs, SDEs, difference equations
6. **Performance First** - Multi-backend support enables GPU and XLA acceleration
