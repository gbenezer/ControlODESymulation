`types.trajectories.TimePoints`

Array of time points for simulation or evaluation.

Discrete time instants at which system is evaluated.

Shape: (n_points,)

Types:
- Regular grid: t = [0, dt, 2*dt, ..., T]
- Irregular grid: t = [0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, ...]
- Adaptive: From adaptive integrator (irregular)

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> # Regular time grid
>>> t: TimePoints = np.linspace(0, 10, 101)
>>> dt = t[1] - t[0]
>>> print(f"dt = {dt:.3f}")  # 0.100
>>> 
>>> # Irregular time grid
>>> t: TimePoints = np.array([0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0])
>>> 
>>> # Logarithmic spacing (for stiff systems)
>>> t: TimePoints = np.logspace(-3, 1, 100)  # 0.001 to 10
>>> 
>>> # From simulation result
>>> result: IntegrationResult = integrator.solve(x0, u, t_span)
>>> t: TimePoints = result['t']
>>> trajectory: StateTrajectory = result['y']
>>> 
>>> # Discrete-time steps (as floats)
>>> k = np.arange(0, 100)
>>> t: TimePoints = k * dt  # Convert to continuous time
