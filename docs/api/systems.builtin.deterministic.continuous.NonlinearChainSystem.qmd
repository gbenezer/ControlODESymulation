Chain of five coupled nonlinear oscillators - first-order formulation.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

A one-dimensional chain of five oscillators where each element influences
its neighbors through nonlinear coupling.

Each oscillator has:
- Linear restoring force (spring-like: -kx)
- Linear damping (viscous: -cx)
- Nonlinear coupling to neighbors via sin(x_j - x_i)
- Only the first oscillator receives external control

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅]
    - x₁: State of oscillator 1 [rad or m]
    - x₂: State of oscillator 2 [rad or m]
    - x₃: State of oscillator 3 [rad or m]
    - x₄: State of oscillator 4 [rad or m]
    - x₅: State of oscillator 5 [rad or m]

Control: u = [u]
    - u: External force/torque applied only to first oscillator
    - Influence propagates to other oscillators through coupling

Output: y = [x₁, x₃, x₅]
    - Sparse observation: only odd-numbered oscillators measured

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The equations of motion form a nearest-neighbor coupling structure:

Oscillator 1 (left boundary, receives control):
    dx₁/dt = -k·x₁ - c·x₁ + α·sin(x₂ - x₁) + u

Oscillator 2 (interior, coupled to neighbors):
    dx₂/dt = -k·x₂ - c·x₂ + α·sin(x₁ - x₂) + α·sin(x₃ - x₂)

Oscillator 3 (interior, coupled to neighbors):
    dx₃/dt = -k·x₃ - c·x₃ + α·sin(x₂ - x₃) + α·sin(x₄ - x₃)

Oscillator 4 (interior, coupled to neighbors):
    dx₄/dt = -k·x₄ - c·x₄ + α·sin(x₃ - x₄) + α·sin(x₅ - x₄)

Oscillator 5 (right boundary, no control):
    dx₅/dt = -k·x₅ - c·x₅ + α·sin(x₄ - x₅)

Physical interpretation:
- Linear terms (-kx, -cx): individual oscillator wants to return to zero
- Nonlinear coupling α·sin(x_j - x_i): synchronization force
  * When x_j > x_i: positive force on i (speeds it up)
  * When x_j < x_i: negative force on i (slows it down)
  * Maximum coupling at π/2 phase difference
- Control u propagates through chain via coupling

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

k : float, default=1.0
    Linear stiffness/restoring coefficient [1/s]. Higher k → stronger
    individual oscillator dynamics, weaker relative coupling influence.
c : float, default=0.1
    Damping coefficient [1/s]. Higher c → faster energy dissipation.
    Damps out transients and oscillations.
alpha : float, default=0.1
    Nonlinear coupling strength. Controls interaction between neighbors:
    - α = 0: Uncoupled oscillators
    - Small α: Weak coupling, local behavior dominates
    - Large α: Strong coupling, collective behavior emerges
    - α > k+c: Coupling-dominated dynamics, synchronization possible

## Equilibrium: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibrium}

Synchronous equilibrium (all at origin):
    x_eq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  (all oscillators aligned at zero)
    u_eq = 0  (no external force)

This equilibrium is stable due to damping. Other synchronized states
(all x_i equal) are also equilibria for u=0.
