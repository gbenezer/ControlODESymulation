Dubins vehicle - kinematic car model with unicycle dynamics.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

A simplified model of a car or mobile robot that can move forward and
rotate, but cannot move sideways (nonholonomic constraint).

The vehicle is modeled as a point with:
- Position (x, y) in the plane
- Heading angle θ
- Forward velocity v (control input)
- Angular velocity ω (control input)

**Key constraint**: The vehicle must move in the direction it's pointing
(no lateral sliding). This is called a nonholonomic constraint.

## Coordinate Frame: {.doc-section .doc-section-coordinate-frame}

- Inertial frame: Fixed (x, y) coordinates
- Body frame: Moves and rotates with vehicle
- Heading θ: Angle from x-axis to vehicle's forward direction

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [x, y, θ]
    - x: Horizontal position [m]
    - y: Vertical position [m]
    - θ (theta): Heading angle [rad]
      * θ = 0: pointing right (along +x axis)
      * θ = π/2: pointing up (along +y axis)
      * θ = π: pointing left
      * θ = 3π/2 or -π/2: pointing down

Control: u = [v, ω]
    - v: Forward velocity [m/s]
      * v > 0: move forward
      * v < 0: move backward
      * v = 0: stopped
    - ω (omega): Angular velocity [rad/s]
      * ω > 0: turn left (counterclockwise)
      * ω < 0: turn right (clockwise)
      * ω = 0: straight motion

Output: y = [x, y, θ]
    - Full state observation (position and heading)

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The kinematic equations (Dubins car model):

    ẋ = v·cos(θ)
    ẏ = v·sin(θ)
    θ̇ = ω

**Position dynamics**:
- Vehicle moves in direction θ at speed v
- cos(θ) and sin(θ) project velocity onto x and y axes
- No motion perpendicular to heading (nonholonomic constraint)

**Heading dynamics**:
- Directly controlled by angular velocity ω
- Independent of forward velocity (can rotate in place if v=0)

Physical interpretation:
- The vehicle is like a bicycle: must point where it's going
- Cannot slide sideways (like a car on dry pavement)
- Minimum turning radius determined by maximum ω/v ratio

## Turning Radius: {.doc-section .doc-section-turning-radius}

When moving in a circle (v constant, ω constant):
    R = v/ω  (radius of circular path)

- Tighter turn: increase ω or decrease v
- Larger turn: decrease ω or increase v
- Straight line: ω = 0

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

This implementation has no physical parameters - it's a pure kinematic
model. Further modifications to this model may include:
- Maximum speed v_max
- Maximum angular velocity ω_max
- Minimum turning radius R_min = v_max/ω_max

## Equilibria: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibria}

**Stationary at origin**:
    x_eq = [0, 0, θ*]  (any heading θ*)
    u_eq = [0, 0]      (no velocity)

Note: Equilibria form a manifold - any (x*, y*, θ*) with u = [0, 0].
The system is marginally stable (doesn't return to equilibrium on its own).
