Path tracking error dynamics for a vehicle following a circular reference path.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

Models the error dynamics of a kinematic vehicle (car, robot, boat) as it
attempts to follow a circular trajectory.

The vehicle uses a bicycle model (front-wheel steering) and the error
coordinates are relative to the closest point on the reference circle.

## Coordinate Frames: {.doc-section .doc-section-coordinate-frames}

- **Reference path**: Circular trajectory with radius R
- **Path frame**: Moving frame tangent to reference path
- **Vehicle frame**: Body-fixed frame of the vehicle
- **Error coordinates**: Deviations from reference path in path frame

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [d_e, θ_e]
    - d_e: Lateral (cross-track) error [m]
      * d_e > 0: vehicle is to the left of the path
      * d_e < 0: vehicle is to the right of the path
      * d_e = 0: vehicle is exactly on the path

    - θ_e: Heading error [rad]
      * θ_e > 0: vehicle heading points left of desired direction
      * θ_e < 0: vehicle heading points right of desired direction
      * θ_e = 0: vehicle heading is tangent to path

Control: u = [δ]
    - δ (delta): Front wheel steering angle [rad]
      * δ > 0: steer left
      * δ < 0: steer right
      * δ = 0: straight ahead

Output: y = [d_e, θ_e]
    - Full state observation (both errors measured)

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The error dynamics describe how tracking errors evolve:

    ḋ_e = v·sin(θ_e)

    θ̇_e = (v·δ)/L - cos(θ_e)/(R/v - sin(θ_e))

**Lateral error rate ḋ_e**:
- Proportional to forward speed v
- Depends on heading error through sin(θ_e)
- When θ_e > 0 (heading left), d_e increases (moves left)
- When θ_e < 0 (heading right), d_e decreases (moves right)

**Heading error rate θ̇_e**:
- First term (v·δ)/L: Vehicle's turning rate (Ackermann steering)
- Second term: Path's curvature rate projection
- At equilibrium, these balance to track the circle

Physical interpretation:
- If vehicle steers more than needed → heading error increases
- If vehicle steers less than needed → heading error decreases
- Coupling: lateral error affects required steering through geometry

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

speed : float, default=1.0
    Constant forward speed of vehicle [m/s]. Assumed to be maintained
    by a low-level speed controller. Higher speed → faster error dynamics.
length : float, default=1.0
    Vehicle wheelbase [m]. Distance between front and rear axles.
    Longer wheelbase → less maneuverable (smaller turning rate).
radius : float, default=10.0
    Radius of the circular reference path [m]. Larger radius → gentler
    turn, easier to track. radius → ∞ approaches straight line tracking.

## Equilibrium: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibrium}

Perfect tracking equilibrium:
    x_eq = [0, 0]  (no lateral error, no heading error)
    u_eq = L/R     (steady-state steering angle for circle)

At equilibrium:
- Vehicle is on the path (d_e = 0)
- Vehicle heading is tangent to path (θ_e = 0)
- Steering angle exactly matches path curvature
- Steady-state steering: δ = L/R = wheelbase/radius
