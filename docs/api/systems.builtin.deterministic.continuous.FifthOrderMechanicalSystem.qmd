Fifth-order mechanical system - extremely high-order dynamics.

**WARNING**: This is an artificially complex system designed for testing
high-order integration schemes. Physical systems rarely exceed third order.

## Physical Interpretation: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-interpretation}

Could represent:
- Flexible manipulator with multiple vibration modes
- Actuator with nested control loops (each adding an order)
- Academic test case for high-order integration

## Mathematical Formulation: {.doc-section .doc-section-mathematical-formulation}

State: x = [q, q', q'', q''', q⁽⁴⁾]
where:
    - q: Position [m]
    - q': Velocity [m/s]
    - q'': Acceleration [m/s²]
    - q''': Jerk [m/s³]
    - q⁽⁴⁾: Snap (fourth derivative) [m/s⁴]

The system evolves according to:
    q⁽⁵⁾ = f(q, q', q'', q''', q⁽⁴⁾, u)

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

q⁽⁵⁾ = -(k/m)q - c₁q' - c₂q'' - c₃q''' - 0.01q⁽⁴⁾ - g + u/m

This includes:
- Stiffness term: -kq (like a spring)
- Multiple damping terms at each derivative level
- Gravity: -g
- Control input: u/m

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

m : float, default=1.0
    Mass [kg]
k : float, default=1.0
    Stiffness coefficient [N/m]
c1 : float, default=0.1
    First-order damping (velocity damping) [N⋅s/m]
c2 : float, default=0.05
    Second-order damping (acceleration damping) [N⋅s³/m]
c3 : float, default=0.01
    Third-order damping (jerk damping) [N⋅s⁵/m]
g : float, default=9.81
    Gravitational acceleration [m/s²]

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [q, q', q'', q''', q⁽⁴⁾]  (5D)
Control: u = [force]  (1D)
Output: y = [q, q']  (position and velocity)

## Equilibrium: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibrium}

Static equilibrium (balancing gravity):
    q_eq = -mg/k  (compressed by gravity)
    All derivatives zero
    u_eq = mg  (supporting weight)
