`types.core.FeedthroughMatrix`

Feedthrough/direct transmission matrix (ny, nu).

Direct control-to-output coupling: y = C*x + D*u.

Typically D = 0 (no direct feedthrough).

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> # No feedthrough (most common)
>>> D: FeedthroughMatrix = np.zeros((2, 1))
>>> 
>>> # Direct feedthrough (sensor measures control)
>>> D_direct: FeedthroughMatrix = np.array([[1.0]])
```
