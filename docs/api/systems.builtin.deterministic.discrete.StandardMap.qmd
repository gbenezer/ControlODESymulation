```

The Standard Map (Chirikov-Taylor Map): Paradigm of Hamiltonian chaos.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

The Standard Map models a kicked rotor: a pendulum that receives periodic
impulses (kicks). Between kicks, the pendulum rotates freely; at each kick,
it receives an angular momentum impulse proportional to sin(θ).

**Physical Setup:**
- Rotor with moment of inertia I (normalized to 1)
- Free rotation between kicks (no gravity, no friction)
- Periodic kicks at times t = n·τ (τ = kick period)
- Kick strength K controls perturbation amplitude

**Hamiltonian Description:**
Between kicks (continuous time):
    H₀ = p²/2  (free rotation)
    θ̇ = ∂H₀/∂p = p
    ṗ = -∂H₀/∂θ = 0

At kicks (instantaneous):
    H_kick = -K·cos(θ)·Σδ(t - nτ)
    Δp = K·sin(θ)

**The Map:**
Combining free rotation + kicks gives discrete-time evolution:
    p[n+1] = p[n] + K·sin(θ[n])
    θ[n+1] = θ[n] + p[n+1]  (mod 2π)

**Key Feature - Area Preservation (Symplectic):**
The Standard Map preserves phase space area (Liouville's theorem):
    |det(Jacobian)| = 1

This is the discrete analog of energy conservation in Hamiltonian systems.
Unlike dissipative systems (logistic map), there are NO attractors -
trajectories fill phase space densely.

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x[n] = [θ[n], p[n]]
    Angular position:
    - θ: Angle [rad], periodic: θ ∈ [0, 2π) or (-π, π]
      * θ = 0: Reference position
      * θ + 2π ≡ θ (rotational symmetry)
      * Represents angular coordinate on circle

    Angular momentum:
    - p: Conjugate momentum [rad/time], unbounded: -∞ < p < ∞
      * p > 0: Counterclockwise rotation
      * p < 0: Clockwise rotation
      * p = 0: Stationary (at kick instant)
      * Between kicks: p is constant of motion
      * At kicks: p changes by K·sin(θ)

**Phase Space Structure:**
The (θ, p) plane has cylindrical topology:
- θ is periodic (circle)
- p is unbounded (line)
- Phase space is a cylinder: S¹ × ℝ

Control: u[n] (optional, for controlled standard map)
    - Can represent:
      * Variable kick strength: K → K + u[n]
      * Additional external torque
      * Feedback control to stabilize orbits
    - Standard map: u = 0 (autonomous)

Output: y[n] = [θ[n], p[n]]
    - Full state measurement (both angle and momentum)
    - In practice:
      * θ measured via encoder/position sensor
      * p inferred from Δθ or measured via velocity sensor

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The Standard Map equations are:

    p[n+1] = p[n] + K·sin(θ[n])
    θ[n+1] = θ[n] + p[n+1]  (mod 2π)

**Mathematical Properties:**

1. **Area-preserving (symplectic):**
   Jacobian determinant = 1 (exactly)
   Phase space volume conserved
   No attractors or repellers

2. **Time-reversal symmetry:**
   Map is reversible: can run backwards
   Inverse map exists

3. **Two-dimensional:**
   Simplest non-integrable Hamiltonian system
   Higher dimensions allow Arnold diffusion

4. **Poincaré map:**
   Samples continuous kicked rotor at kick times
   Reduces continuous flow to discrete map

5. **Periodic in θ:**
   f(θ + 2π, p) = f(θ, p) + (2π, 0)
   Allows folding phase space onto cylinder

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

K : float, default=1.0
    Kick strength (stochasticity parameter)

    **Physical Meaning:**
    - K measures perturbation strength relative to free motion
    - Dimensionless parameter (ratio of kick to rotation)
    - Controls degree of nonlinearity

    **Parameter Regimes:**

    **K = 0:**
    - Integrable limit (no kicks)
    - Pure rotation: θ[n+1] = θ[n] + p₀
    - All orbits are straight lines in (θ, p)
    - Every trajectory is regular (quasi-periodic)
    - Phase space foliated by invariant tori

    **0 < K < 0.5:**
    - Near-integrable regime
    - Most phase space covered by KAM tori (invariant curves)
    - Small chaotic regions near separatrices
    - Orbits mostly regular, quasi-periodic
    - KAM theorem applies: most tori survive

    **K ≈ 0.971635...**
    - Critical threshold for last KAM torus
    - Golden mean winding number (most robust)
    - Below: global stochastic layer blocked by KAM tori
    - Above: trajectories can diffuse to arbitrarily large |p|

    **0.5 < K < 2:**
    - Mixed phase space
    - Chaotic seas coexist with regular islands
    - Resonance overlap (Chirikov criterion)
    - Some KAM tori destroyed, others persist
    - Complicated fractal boundary structure

    **2 < K < 5:**
    - Mostly chaotic
    - Few surviving islands (high-order resonances)
    - Large-scale chaos, but bounded regions remain
    - Cantori (destroyed tori) create partial barriers

    **K > 5:**
    - Fully developed chaos
    - Almost all phase space is chaotic
    - Fast momentum diffusion: ⟨p²⟩ ~ K²·n (classical diffusion)
    - Only tiny islands remain at high-order resonances

    **K → ∞:**
    - Random walk limit
    - Momentum diffusion coefficient: D ~ K²/2
    - Approaches Brownian motion

dt : float, default=1.0
    Time between kicks (kick period τ)
    - Usually normalized to 1
    - Physical time scale (seconds, milliseconds, etc.)
    - Doesn't affect map dynamics (only units)

use_wrapped_theta : bool, default=True
    If True, θ ∈ [0, 2π); if False, θ unbounded
    - Wrapped: Natural for rotational dynamics
    - Unwrapped: Useful for tracking rotation number

## Equilibria and Periodic Orbits: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibria-and-periodic-orbits}

Unlike dissipative systems, the Standard Map has NO fixed points in
the usual sense (except at K = 0). Instead, it has:

**Periodic Orbits:**
- Period-1: (θ*, p*) such that map returns after 1 iteration
- Period-n: Returns after n iterations
- Infinitely many periodic orbits of each period
- Form hierarchical island chain structure

**Resonances:**
For small K, periodic orbits occur near:
    p ≈ 2πm/n  (m, n integers)

These are resonances where rotation number is rational.

**Elliptic vs Hyperbolic Fixed Points:**
- Elliptic: Stable, surrounded by invariant curves (islands)
- Hyperbolic: Unstable, with stable/unstable manifolds (X-points)

**Example Period-1 Orbits (K small):**
- (0, 0): Elliptic, stable
- (π, 0): Hyperbolic, unstable (separatrix)

**KAM Tori (Invariant Curves):**
For K < K_critical, some invariant curves survive:
- Most robust: Golden mean winding number
    ω = (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.618...
- Form barriers to chaotic transport
- Destroy via resonance overlap as K increases

## KAM Theory and Resonance Overlap: {.doc-section .doc-section-kam-theory-and-resonance-overlap}

**KAM Theorem (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser):**
For sufficiently small perturbations, MOST invariant tori survive,
though they are deformed. Tori are destroyed if:
1. Winding number is rational (resonance)
2. Winding number is "too well approximated" by rationals

**Chirikov Resonance Overlap Criterion:**
Chaos sets in when neighboring resonances overlap:
    ΔK ≈ K·(width of resonances)

For Standard Map:
    K_critical ≈ 1 for onset of global stochasticity

**Greene's Residue Criterion:**
Precise threshold: K_c ≈ 0.971635...
Last KAM torus has golden mean winding number.

**Mixed Phase Space:**
For K < K_c:
- Chaotic sea confined by KAM tori
- Regular islands embedded in chaos
- Fractal boundaries (cantori)
- No global diffusion

For K > K_c:
- Trajectories can diffuse to arbitrarily large |p|
- Stochastic layer connects all regions
- Cantori (partial barriers) slow diffusion

## Chaos Characterization: {.doc-section .doc-section-chaos-characterization}

**Lyapunov Exponents:**
Area preservation implies:
    λ₁ + λ₂ = 0  (sum of Lyapunov exponents = 0)

If λ₁ > 0 (chaos), then λ₂ = -λ₁ < 0.

**Rotation Number:**
For regular orbits, rotation number is defined:
    ω = lim (θ[n] - θ[0])/(2πn)
       n→∞

- Rational ω: Periodic orbit
- Irrational ω: Quasi-periodic (on KAM torus)
- Undefined ω: Chaotic orbit

**Poincaré-Birkhoff Theorem:**
Each rational rotation number has at least two periodic orbits:
one elliptic (stable) and one hyperbolic (unstable).

**Winding Number Distribution:**
For chaotic orbits, winding number has probabilistic description.

## Momentum Diffusion: {.doc-section .doc-section-momentum-diffusion}

In chaotic regime, momentum performs random walk:
    ⟨p²⟩ ~ D·n

Diffusion coefficient:
- K small: D ~ exp(-const/K) (exponentially suppressed)
- K large: D ~ K²/2 (classical random walk)

**Acceleration Modes:**
At special K values, ballistic growth possible:
    ⟨p²⟩ ~ n²  (super-diffusive)

This occurs when dynamics resonates with map periodicity.

## Control Objectives: {.doc-section .doc-section-control-objectives}

**1. Chaos Control:**
   Goal: Stabilize unstable periodic orbits (UPO)
   Method: OGY (Ott-Grebogi-Yorke) control
   - Locate UPO in chaotic sea
   - Apply small perturbations to K
   - Stabilize orbit with minimal control

**2. Chaos Suppression:**
   Goal: Restore regular motion by feedback
   Control: u[n] = -K_control·sin(θ[n])
   Reduces effective K below chaos threshold

**3. Accelerator Mode Stabilization:**
   Goal: Maintain accelerator mode for rapid transport
   Applications: Particle beam control

**4. Island Confinement:**
   Goal: Keep trajectory within regular island
   Useful for stability in beam dynamics

**5. Transport Enhancement:**
   Goal: Maximize momentum diffusion
   Applications: Mixing, ergodic optimization

## Numerical Considerations: {.doc-section .doc-section-numerical-considerations}

**Angle Wrapping:**
Always reduce θ modulo 2π to keep in [0, 2π):
    θ[n+1] = (θ[n] + p[n+1]) % (2π)

Without wrapping, θ grows unbounded, complicating visualization.

**Area Preservation Check:**
Jacobian should always have determinant = 1:
    J = | ∂θ[n+1]/∂θ[n]  ∂θ[n+1]/∂p[n] |
        | ∂p[n+1]/∂θ[n]  ∂p[n+1]/∂p[n]  |

det(J) = 1 + K·cos(θ)·1 - K·cos(θ)·1 = 1 ✓

**Long-Time Integration:**
- Standard Map is exactly area-preserving (no drift)
- Can integrate indefinitely without accumulation of error
- Unlike approximate integrators for continuous systems
- Roundoff errors may accumulate but don't break symplecticity

**Initial Conditions:**
Choice of (θ₀, p₀) determines orbit character:
- Regular regions: orbit stays on torus
- Chaotic sea: orbit explores allowed region
- Near separatrix: most sensitive to K

**Visualization:**
Phase space plots (Poincaré sections):
- Plot (θ[n], p[n]) for many iterations
- Regular orbits → closed curves (tori)
- Chaotic orbits → scattered points (dense filling)
- Mixed: islands + chaotic sea

## Physical Insights: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-insights}

**Why Area Preservation Matters:**
Conservation of phase space volume is the discrete analog of energy
conservation. Unlike dissipative systems:
- No attractors (everything keeps moving)
- No basins of attraction
- Volume in phase space is conserved
- Ergodic properties possible

**KAM Tori as Barriers:**
Invariant curves (KAM tori) act as impenetrable barriers:
- Prevent momentum diffusion
- Confine chaotic regions
- When destroyed → global transport possible
- Golden mean torus is most robust

**Resonance Overlap:**
Chaos emerges when perturbation strong enough that:
- Neighboring resonances overlap
- Separatrices intersect chaotically
- Homoclinic tangle forms
- Regular motion destroyed

**Connection to Quantum Mechanics:**
Standard Map is prototypical for quantum chaos:
- Classical chaos ↔ Quantum eigenfunctions
- K plays role of effective ℏ (inverse)
- "Quantum" Standard Map shows localization
- Dynamical Anderson localization

**Accelerator Physics:**
Standard Map models:
- Particles in storage rings
- RF cavity kicks
- Nonlinear resonances
- Beam stability criteria

**Celestial Mechanics:**
Analogous to:
- Asteroid belt gaps (resonances with Jupiter)
- Satellite orbit perturbations
- Three-body problem (restricted)
- Kirkwood gaps explained by resonance overlap

## Common Pitfalls: {.doc-section .doc-section-common-pitfalls}

1. **Forgetting angle wrapping:**
   Must reduce θ mod 2π for correct visualization
   Unwrapped θ grows linearly with rotation

2. **Confusing with dissipative maps:**
   Standard Map has NO attractors
   Phase space is uniformly filled (ergodic)
   Cannot use attractor-finding methods

3. **Insufficient iterations:**
   Need many iterations (>1000) to see structure
   Chaotic orbits fill region densely
   Regular orbits trace closed curves slowly

4. **Wrong initial conditions:**
   Different regions show different behavior
   Need to sample many ICs to see full phase space

5. **Ignoring symplectic structure:**
   Standard Map exactly preserves det(J) = 1
   Numerical methods must respect this
   Standard integration schemes may fail

6. **Rotation number convergence:**
   Chaotic orbits have no well-defined rotation number
   Regular orbits require many iterations to converge
   Rational approximations can be misleading

## Extensions and Variations: {.doc-section .doc-section-extensions-and-variations}

1. **Generalized Standard Map:**
   p[n+1] = p[n] + K·f(θ[n])
   θ[n+1] = θ[n] + p[n+1]
   Different f(θ) changes chaos threshold

2. **Dissipative Standard Map:**
   p[n+1] = γ·p[n] + K·sin(θ[n])
   θ[n+1] = θ[n] + p[n+1]
   γ < 1 breaks area preservation, creates attractors

3. **Standard Map with Noise:**
   Stochastic perturbations
   Studies interplay of chaos and noise

4. **Four-Dimensional Standard Map:**
   Two coupled kicked rotors
   Shows Arnold diffusion

5. **Quantum Standard Map:**
   Kicked rotor in quantum mechanics
   Dynamical localization phenomenon

6. **Web Map (K < 0):**
   Accelerator-mode version
   Ballistic momentum growth

Compute rotation number (winding number) for regular orbits.

For regular (quasi-periodic) orbits on KAM tori:
    ω = lim (θ[n] - θ[0])/(2πn)
       n→∞

...     print(f"Rotation number: ω = {omega:.6f}")
```

#### Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

For chaotic orbits, rotation number is undefined (returns None).
For rational rotation numbers, orbit is periodic.
For irrational rotation numbers, orbit is quasi-periodic (on torus).

### setup_equilibria { #cdesym.systems.builtin.deterministic.discrete.StandardMap.setup_equilibria }

```python
systems.builtin.deterministic.discrete.StandardMap.setup_equilibria()
```

Set up periodic orbits (no true fixed points for K ≠ 0).

For K ≠ 0, there are no fixed points, only periodic orbits.
We add the origin as a "reference point" for small K.

```python
systems.builtin.deterministic.discrete.StandardMap.step(
    x,
    u=None,

    backend=None,
)
```

Override step to add angle wrapping if enabled.
