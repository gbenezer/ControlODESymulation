Coupled mass-spring-damper system with rotational coupling - first-order formulation.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

Two masses connected by springs to fixed walls and to each other, with an
additional rotational degree of freedom that couples to the second mass.

The system consists of:
- Two point masses (m₁, m₂) that can move horizontally
- Springs connecting each mass to ground (k₁, k₂)
- Coupling spring between the masses (k_coupling)
- Viscous dampers on both masses (shared coefficient c)
- Rotational element (moment of inertia J) coupled to mass 2

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [x₁, x₂, v₁, v₂, θ]
    Position coordinates:
    - x₁: Position of mass 1 [m]
    - x₂: Position of mass 2 [m]
    - θ (theta): Rotational angle [rad]

    Velocity coordinates:
    - v₁: Velocity of mass 1 [m/s]
    - v₂: Velocity of mass 2 [m/s]

Control: u = [u₁, u₂]
    - u₁: Force applied to mass 1 [N]
    - u₂: Combined force/torque applied to mass 2 and rotational element

Output: y = [x₁, x₂, θ]
    - Measures positions of both masses and rotational angle

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The equations of motion are:

Mass 1 (standard spring-mass-damper):
    dx₁/dt = v₁
    dv₁/dt = -(k₁/m₁)x₁ - (k_c/m₁)(x₁ - x₂) - (c/m₁)v₁ + u₁/m₁

Mass 2 (coupled to rotation):
    dx₂/dt = v₂
    dv₂/dt = -(k₂/m₂)x₂ - (k_c/m₂)(x₂ - x₁) - (c/m₂)v₂ + sin(θ)/m₂ + u₂/m₂

Rotational element:
    dθ/dt = -θ/J - x₂/J + u₂/(2J)

Physical interpretation:
- Springs create restoring forces proportional to displacement
- Coupling spring connects the two masses
- Dampers dissipate energy proportionally to velocity
- Rotation affects mass 2 through sin(θ) term (nonlinear coupling)
- Control u₂ affects both mass 2 translation and rotation

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

m1 : float, default=1.0
    Mass of first oscillator [kg]. Larger m₁ → slower response to forces.
m2 : float, default=0.5
    Mass of second oscillator [kg]. Typically different from m₁ to create
    interesting modal behavior.
k1 : float, default=2.0
    Spring stiffness connecting mass 1 to ground [N/m]. Higher k₁ →
    higher natural frequency for mass 1.
k2 : float, default=1.0
    Spring stiffness connecting mass 2 to ground [N/m].
k_coupling : float, default=0.5
    Coupling spring stiffness between masses [N/m]. Controls strength of
    interaction between oscillators. Higher k_c → stronger coupling.
c : float, default=0.1
    Damping coefficient [N·s/m]. Applied to both masses. Higher c →
    more energy dissipation.
J : float, default=0.1
    Moment of inertia for rotational element [kg·m²]. Affects rotational
    response time.

## Equilibrium: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibrium}

Origin equilibrium (all zeros):
    x_eq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  (masses at rest, no rotation)
    u_eq = [0, 0]  (no external forces)

This equilibrium is stable due to spring restoring forces and damping.
