Planar Vertical Take-Off and Landing (PVTOL) aircraft - second-order formulation.

## Physical System: {.doc-section .doc-section-physical-system}

A simplified model of a VTOL aircraft (helicopter, drone)
constrained to move in a vertical plane.

The aircraft has:
- Two thrust actuators (left and right, or front and back)
- Ability to rotate (pitch) and translate (x, y)
- Gravity acting downward
- Thrust-vectoring through body rotation

**Key feature**: Underactuated with 2 inputs controlling 3 degrees of freedom.
Must use rotation (θ) to control horizontal motion (x).

## Coordinate Frame: {.doc-section .doc-section-coordinate-frame}

This implementation uses body-fixed velocity coordinates, which is common
in aircraft dynamics:
- Position (x, y): In inertial (world) frame
- Velocities (ẋ, ẏ): In body frame (rotates with aircraft)
- Angle θ: Pitch angle in inertial frame

## State Space: {.doc-section .doc-section-state-space}

State: x = [x, y, θ, ẋ, ẏ, θ̇]
    Position coordinates (inertial frame):
    - x: Horizontal position [m] (positive right)
    - y: Vertical position [m] (positive up)
    - θ (theta): Pitch angle [rad]
      * θ = 0: level (horizontal orientation)
      * θ > 0: nose up (pitched back)
      * θ < 0: nose down (pitched forward)

    Velocity coordinates (body frame):
    - ẋ (x_dot): Velocity in body x-direction [m/s]
    - ẏ (y_dot): Velocity in body y-direction [m/s]
    - θ̇ (theta_dot): Angular velocity [rad/s]

Control: u = [u₁, u₂]
    - u₁: Left/front thrust [N]
    - u₂: Right/back thrust [N]
    Both must be non-negative in physical systems (thrust-only)

Output: y = [x, y, θ]
    - Measures position and orientation

## Dynamics: {.doc-section .doc-section-dynamics}

The PVTOL dynamics in body frame are:

    ẍ_body = ẏ·θ̇ - g·sin(θ)
    ÿ_body = -ẋ·θ̇ - g·cos(θ) + (u₁ + u₂)/m
    θ̈ = d/I · (u₁ - u₂)

**Horizontal acceleration (ẍ_body)**:
- ẏ·θ̇: Centrifugal effect from rotation
- -g·sin(θ): Gravity component in body x-direction
- Controlled indirectly through angle θ

**Vertical acceleration (ÿ_body)**:
- -ẋ·θ̇: Coriolis effect from rotation
- -g·cos(θ): Gravity component in body y-direction
- (u₁ + u₂)/m: Total thrust divided by mass

**Angular acceleration (θ̈)**:
- d/I · (u₁ - u₂): Torque from differential thrust
- d: Distance from center of mass to thrusters
- I: Moment of inertia

## Parameters: {.doc-section .doc-section-parameters}

length : float, default=0.25
    Half-distance between thrusters [m]. Also interpreted as distance
    from center of mass to each thruster. Larger L → more control
    authority for rotation (more torque per thrust difference).
mass : float, default=4.0
    Total mass of aircraft [kg]. Larger mass → slower acceleration
    response, more thrust needed to hover.
inertia : float, default=0.0475
    Moment of inertia about center of mass [kg·m²]. Larger I →
    slower rotational response.
gravity : float, default=9.8
    Gravitational acceleration [m/s²].
dist : float, default=0.25
    Lever arm for torque generation [m]. Often equals length.
    Determines θ̈ = (dist/inertia)·(u₁ - u₂).

## Equilibria: {.doc-section .doc-section-equilibria}

**Hovering (level flight)**:
    x_eq = [x*, y*, 0, 0, 0, 0]  (any position, level, stationary)
    u_eq = [mg/2, mg/2]  (equal thrust, each supporting half weight)

At hover:
- Total thrust balances gravity: u₁ + u₂ = mg
- Differential thrust is zero: u₁ - u₂ = 0
- No rotation: θ = 0

**Tilted hover** (advanced):
    For x_eq = [x*, y*, θ*, 0, 0, 0] with θ* ≠ 0:
    Requires different thrust distribution to maintain position
